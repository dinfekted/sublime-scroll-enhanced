# Sublime ScrollEnhanced plugin

Replacement for default "scroll_lines" command. It does not move cursor when
scrolling.


### Demo

![Demo](https://github.com/shagabutdinov/sublime-enhanced-demos/raw/master/scroll_enhanced.gif "Demo")


### Reason

Sublime's default scroll_lines moved cursor while scrolling that annoyed me a
lot (I had to place marks any time when scrolled just to get a look at source
code). So I did this plgin and got rid of default annoying behaviour.
